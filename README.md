# Finding longest prefix of a number using Trie data structure
- Java project for finding the largest telephone prefix code to the phone number and finding the cheapest opearator for that number from a list of operators.
 I've come up with two different implementations for this problem
  - First implementation is a brute force approach with a cubic time complexity.
  - Second implementation is an optimized algorithm using Trie     data structure. It is a prefix tree. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n*m). where n is number of operators and m is the length of the phone number.
- The project is in java 17
- Execute the program from Main.java
- New inputs can be provided in priceList.addOperator() method
- The code includes object oriented principles like encapsulation.

Contents:
 - Operator  - Class for a single operator
 - PriceList - Class for a list of operators
 - Trie - class to implement Trie data stricture
 - Algorithms - implementation of two algorithms
 - Every code has a unit test
